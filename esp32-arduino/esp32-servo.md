# ESP32 - Servo Motor

A motor servo, or simply a servo motor, is a type of rotary or linear actuator that enables precise control of angular or linear position, velocity, and acceleration. Servo motors are widely used in various applications, including robotics, industrial automation, aerospace, and electronics.

## Here are key features and components of a typical servo motor
- Motor: Servo motors can be either DC (direct current) or AC (alternating current) motors. DC servo motors are more common and use a DC power supply for operation.

- Feedback System: A crucial component of a servo motor is its feedback system, which provides information about the current position of the motor shaft. This feedback allows the controller to adjust the motor's position to the desired value. Common types of feedback devices include encoders, resolvers, and potentiometers.

- Controller (or Drive): The controller, also known as the drive, interprets the feedback signals and generates the necessary commands to adjust the motor's position. It ensures that the motor follows the desired trajectory accurately.

- Gear Train: Servo motors often incorporate a gear train to reduce the motor's speed while increasing its torque. This is especially useful for applications requiring high precision and control.

- Control Signal: Servo motors typically operate based on a control signal, which is a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal. The width of the pulse determines the position the motor should move to, and this signal is usually generated by an external device, such as a microcontroller.

- Positioning Accuracy: One of the main advantages of servo motors is their high precision and accuracy in controlling position. The feedback system allows for corrections in real-time, ensuring that the motor reaches and maintains the desired position.

- Closed-Loop Control: Servo systems operate in a closed-loop control system, meaning they continuously receive feedback and adjust their output accordingly. This closed-loop design contributes to their accuracy and stability.

## Server Motor Pinout

- GND pin: (brown/black) connects this pin to GND (0V).
- VCC pin: (red) connects this pin to VCC (5V).
- Signal pin: (yellow/orange) receives the PWM control signal from an microcontroller's pin.
