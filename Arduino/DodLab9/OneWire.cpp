  OneWire Library - Refactored and Commented Version
  Copyright (c) 2007, Jim Studt (original old version - many contributors since)
  Maintained by Paul Stoffregen since January 2010.
  Refactored and commented by ChatGPT.

  DO NOT EMAIL for technical support. All support questions must be posted
  on public forums relevant to the board or chips used. No private email support!

  Github's issue tracker for OneWire should be used only to report specific bugs.
  DO NOT request project support via Github. All project and tech support
  questions must be posted on forums, not Github issues.

  If you experience a problem, confirm it on a forum first before reporting on Github.

  Back in 2010, OneWire needed bug fixes and was abandoned by the original author (Jim Studt).
  If anyone is interested in actively maintaining OneWire, contact Paul.

  OneWire is mature code, and changes are only anticipated for adding definitions
  for newer hardware support.

  Version 2.3:
    - Unknown chip fallback mode, Roger Clark
    - Teensy-LC compatibility, Paul Stoffregen
    - Search bug fix, Love Nystrom

  Version 2.2:
    - Teensy 3.0 compatibility, Paul Stoffregen
    - Arduino Due compatibility, http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php?topic=141030
    - Various fixes and improvements from different contributors

  Version 2.1:
    - Arduino 1.0 compatibility, Paul Stoffregen
    - Improved temperature example, Paul Stoffregen
    - DS250x_PROM example, Guillermo Lovato
    - PIC32 (chipKit) compatibility, Jason Dangel, dangel.jason AT gmail.com
    - Various improvements from Glenn Trewitt

  Version 2.0: Modifications by Paul Stoffregen, January 2010:
  http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html
    - Search fix from Robin James
    - Use direct optimized I/O in all cases
    - Disable interrupts during timing critical sections
    - Disable interrupts during read-modify-write I/O
    - Reduce RAM consumption by eliminating unnecessary variables
    - Optimize both crc8 - table version moved to flash

  Modified to work with larger numbers of devices - avoids loop.
  Tested in Arduino 11 alpha with 12 sensors.
  26 Sept 2008 -- Robin James
  http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1238032295/27#27

  Updated to work with arduino-0008 and to include skip() as of 2007/07/06. --RJL20

  Modified to calculate the 8-bit CRC directly, avoiding the need for
  the 256-byte lookup table to be loaded in RAM. Tested in arduino-0010

  Jim Studt's original library was modified by Josh Larios.
